It was 2020, early spring, when the pandemic hit.

It killed hundreds of thousands of people and made millions sick.

It had to be just a matter of time before the walking dead roamed the 
abandoned places.

Anticipating the zombie takeover, and reasoning that whoever was left 
after the plague would need adequate library services, regardless of 
their state of putrefaction, the librarians placed 
recordings all over the building, at important places and inside rooms.

Walk around the library by pressing the arrow keys or the w s a d keys.

Find and touch the radios to turn them on.

Press the m key to look at the Map of the library.

college forms, finding a classroom, that kind of stuff.
